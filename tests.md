## 1. A Sticky Call-to-Action
A potential enhancement would be to create a button that is fixed to the bottom right of the viewport. It would only appear once the user has scrolled down the page far enough. It could either lead to:
* The Google Play Store (Download)
* The Demo App (/demo)

## 2. A More In-Depth Demo
This application only holds a temporary Weather App on the "/demo" page. It could be enhanced to allow the user to interact with it. Such interactions could be:
* Allowing the User to change their Location
* A way to "Favorite" certain days so the user can easily plan their day out.

## 3. Put Weather API Data on the Landing Page
There are several areas within the Landing Page that could benefit with some Weather Data from the API. Specifically, the section with the Phone and Text sitting in the center.

Instead of having a static Phone image, a quick preview of Today's current weather would be more useful to the user.
