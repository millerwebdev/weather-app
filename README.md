# React Weather App!
This Application uses NPM, React & React Router DOM.

## Dependancies & Initial Setup
As stated above, this project requires Node.js / NPM, so BEFORE continuing, please make sure Node.js exists on the target machine.

If you are not sure if Node is installed, simply open a Terminal of your choosing, and run the following command:

> node --version

If a version number comes up, Node is installed. Otherwise, you can find a download link here:

>https://nodejs.org/en/

Lastly, I use VS Code as my editor of choice, so there are instructions included for VS Code Setup, as well as traditional Command Line / Terminal Setup.


## How to Run Locally

### Command Line
1. Open up a Command Prompt (PowerShell for Windows, or Terminal for Mac)
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to clone the Repo to
3. Run the following command to Clone the Repo:
> git clone https://github.com/millerwebdev/weather-app.git
4. The Repo will create a Folder called "weather-app", navigate into that folder once the Clone has completed
5. Once inside the folder, use the following command to install npm and retrieve all the dependancies
> npm install
6. Once npm has finished installing you can use the following command to start the Local Development Server
> npm start

That's it! After the "npm start" command, a browser should pop up and load the Weather App!

### VS Code
The steps for VS Code are essentially the same as Above, only utilizing VS Code's built in Terminal.

1. Open VS Code and navigate to the folder you wish to Clone this Repo to.
2. Once inside your folder, run the following command in the VS Code Terminal to Clone the Repo:
> git clone https://github.com/millerwebdev/weather-app.git
3. Once the Repo has finished cloning, run the following command in the VS Code Terminal:
> npm install
4. After npm finishes installing, you can use the following command in the VS Code Terminal to start the Development Server:
> npm start

Huzzah! After the "npm start" command, a browser should pop up and load the Weather App!


### That's all, folks!
