# React Weather App!
This Application uses React with React Router DOM.

## How to Run Locally
To run this App locally, follow these steps below:

1. Clone this Repo to a folder of your choosing.
> git clone https://github.com/millerwebdev/weather-app.git

2. Once it has been Cloned, navigate to the folder either within VS Code or via the Command Line.

3. Within either the Terminal in VS Code, or in the Command Line, run the following command to install npm.
> npm install

4. After npm finishes installing, the application should be all set to run locally. Use the command below to start the Development Server.
> npm start

### Potential Issues
While testing out the method above, I had a couple attempts where React could not find the React Router DOM dependancy. Should this happen, use the command below in between steps 3 and 4.
> npm install react-router-dom

### That's all, folks!
